#+title: Speedrunning Gentoo

I always wanted to create notes for Gentoo setup
with the least amount of optional steps. And see how
fast you can install it. However I am not ditching any useful
tools or setup steps. The idea is that you get a fully usable
system at the end

* SystemD XFS TTY

plain install based on stable systemd merged-usr profile using xfs
file system and default layout from handbook with systemd-boot

- Use default layout
- Use xfs
- Install networking stack (NetworkManager)
- Use systemd-boot
- Make it boot :-)
